Windows is a huge pain to get working properly.

* Install windows SDK dev kit (get GRMSDKX_EN_DVD.iso if you're on 64 bit or GRMSDK_EN_DVD.iso on 32 bit)
* Install 7-zip:
	- http://www.7-zip.org/download.html
* Install python2.7 for windows - USE 32 BIT VERSION IF YOU CAN
	- https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/ (scroll to downloads)
* Setup environmental variables
	- Right click my computer
	- properties
	- advanced system settings
	- environmental settngs
	- scroll down system settings pane until you find Path
	- append path to python.exe to path variable
* Install pip
	- https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-7.1.2.tar.gz#md5=3823d2343d9f3aaab21cf9c917710196
* Install wheel
	- python -m "pip" install wheel
* Install the netifaces EXE (source code version will give an error.) If you have 64 bit python build from source after vcvars bat has been run (see bellow for VC section)
* Install numpy
    * Download http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ for your platform + python version
    * Use python -m "pip" install wheel_file_name to install it
* Install pycharm for Windows
* Install Git - select unix tools because they are awesome.
* Open pycharm and make new projects for these Git repos: storj/pyp2p/develop and storj/storjnode/develop
* With the projects now open in pycharm: use pycharm to automatically install all the requirment packages on Windows (its faster). Note it will fail on some packages.
* Download graphwiz installer for Windows
	- http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php
* Install the graphwiz wheel:
	- python -m "wheel" install 
	- https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/g/graphviz/graphviz-0.4.8-py2.py3-none-any.whl#md5=8a320ee55b79013c91b3ee214ded004a
* Install Mingw
	- http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files
* Install pywin32 extension for your python version: 
	- http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/
* Install VC C++ 9.0 (if you get VC C++ 9.0 errors when trying to setup pyp2p or storjnode)
	- http://microsoft-visual-c-2008.en.softonic.com/
    ( Make sure you go to configuration options and untick the extras -- I think it tries to bundle spyware.)
	* Open DOS:
		- cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin"
		- vcvars32.bat
		- cd back to where the package is
		- now run it
		
		* Completely uninstall pycrypto
			- close all pycharm windows
			- python -m "pip" uninstall pycrypto
		* Reinstall pycrypto 2.6.1 using voicespace binaries:
			- http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/pycrypto-2.6.1/ (get the EXE)
* Set the line endings on Windows:
	- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2517190/how-do-i-force-git-to-use-lf-instead-of-crlf-under-windows


Py2exe instructions:
* Open up the site-packes dir for your python install
* For all .egg and .egg-info files: extract them as if they were a zip and then append their original extension to the name -- this is so py2exe can find them
* You will need to also create a blank __init__.py in Lib\site-packages\zope + add twisted to the list of packages in the setup.py file
